# Frontend Application

This directory is prepared for the frontend application implementation.

## Planned Structure

The frontend will be organized to support modern web development practices:

```
frontend/
├── src/                     # Source code
│   ├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/              # Page components
│   ├── services/           # API service layer
│   ├── utils/              # Utility functions
│   └── styles/             # Styling files
├── public/                 # Static assets
├── tests/                  # Frontend tests
├── package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
└── README.md              # This file
```

## Backend Integration

The frontend will communicate with the backend API running on:
- Development: `http://localhost:8000`
- Production: Configure via environment variables

## Available Backend Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /health/ready` - Readiness check
- `GET /` - Application information

## Next Steps

1. Choose a frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
2. Set up the build system and development tools
3. Implement the user interface
4. Add API integration with the backend
5. Set up testing and deployment pipelines

## Development

Once implemented, the frontend development server will typically run on:
- `http://localhost:3000` (React, Next.js)
- `http://localhost:8080` (Vue.js)
- `http://localhost:4200` (Angular)

The backend is already configured to allow CORS requests from these common development ports.
