# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves reorganizing the existing FastAPI application into a clear backend and frontend architecture. The current codebase is a monolithic FastAPI service with health check endpoints. The goal is to separate concerns by creating a dedicated backend API service and a simple frontend web application that displays the health status by calling the backend's health check endpoint.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized into separate backend and frontend directories, so that I can maintain clear separation of concerns and enable independent development of each component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the project SHALL have a `backend/` directory containing the FastAPI application
2. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the project SHALL have a `frontend/` directory containing the web frontend application
3. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the existing FastAPI code SHALL be moved to the backend directory with minimal modifications
4. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the backend SHALL maintain all existing functionality including health endpoints, logging, error handling, and configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple web page that shows the health status of the backend service, so that I can quickly verify if the system is operational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the frontend application THEN the system SHALL display a web page showing the backend health status
2. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL make an HTTP request to the backend's `/health` endpoint
3. WHEN the health check succeeds THEN the page SHALL display "Service Status: Healthy" with a green indicator
4. WHEN the health check fails THEN the page SHALL display "Service Status: Unhealthy" with a red indicator
5. WHEN the page loads THEN it SHALL show the service name, version, and last check timestamp
6. WHEN the health status is displayed THEN the page SHALL auto-refresh every 30 seconds to show current status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to serve as a proper API service, so that it can be consumed by the frontend and potentially other clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is running THEN it SHALL be accessible on a configurable port (default 8000)
2. WHEN the frontend makes requests to the backend THEN the backend SHALL handle CORS properly to allow frontend access
3. WHEN the backend receives requests THEN it SHALL maintain all existing logging, error handling, and response formatting
4. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL continue to provide the same health check endpoints (`/health` and `/health/ready`)
5. WHEN the backend is accessed THEN it SHALL continue to serve API documentation at `/docs` in development mode

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to be a modern React application using best practices and proven libraries, so that it's maintainable, scalable, and follows current industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend is implemented THEN it SHALL be a React application using TypeScript for type safety
2. WHEN the frontend is built THEN it SHALL use modern React patterns including functional components and hooks
3. WHEN the frontend is styled THEN it SHALL use a modern CSS-in-JS solution or utility-first CSS framework for maintainable styling
4. WHEN the frontend starts THEN it SHALL be served on a configurable port (default 3000) using a modern development server
5. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN it SHALL use a proven HTTP client library and handle network errors gracefully
6. WHEN the frontend displays data THEN it SHALL format timestamps in a human-readable format using a date utility library
7. WHEN the frontend encounters an error THEN it SHALL show user-friendly error messages with proper error boundaries
8. WHEN the frontend is built THEN it SHALL follow React best practices including proper component structure, state management, and performance optimization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want updated documentation and configuration files, so that I can easily run both the backend and frontend components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the project SHALL have updated README files for both backend and frontend
2. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the project SHALL have a root-level README explaining how to run both components
3. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the project SHALL have updated Docker configuration supporting both services
4. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the project SHALL have a docker-compose.yml that can start both backend and frontend services
5. WHEN the reorganization is complete THEN the project SHALL maintain the existing development scripts and tools adapted for the new structure
